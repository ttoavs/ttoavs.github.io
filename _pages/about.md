Hello! I'm a Data Scientist currently finishing up my Ph.D. at Louisiana State University. My dissertation research topic is centered around flowing freshwater CO2 across the United States. More specifically, I am addressing macroscale catchment land use patterns and their effect on in-stream carbon dynamics. Ecological and hydrological data has always been a passion of mine. During my undergrad at the University of Minnesota, I earned a B.S. in Fish and Wildlife Biology.

Above all, I just like working with data from processing unstructured observation to creating models to gain insight and answer well throughout questions.

I have two objectives in creating this site:

1. Showcase academic and nonacademic data science projects (_i.e._, portfolio).
2. Throughout my past work experience, academic studies, and my current role as a graduate researcher I have picked up a few skills that I think others may find useful. So, I am including a blog section and hope to contribute regularly.

Have a look around and reach out for questions or if you find anything helpful!
