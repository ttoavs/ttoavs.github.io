Hello! My name is Tim and I am a data nerd currently finishing up my Ph.D. at Louisiana State University. I have had a unqiue jouney to get where I am today. Upon graduation I plan to pursue a career in data where I can utilize my unique perspectives and techincal skills.

### This webpage is intended to:

- Showcase my technical skills and qualifications for future employers through portfolio projects
- Display my academic publications
- Provide insight through blog posts based on knowledge I've gained throughout my career

### Personal Life

I love everything about the outdoors and spend as much time as I can in it.

Also, here is a picture of my dog Sprout wearing a fish shirt!
