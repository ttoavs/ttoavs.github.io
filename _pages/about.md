Hello! My names is Tim and I am a Data Analyst currently finishing up my Ph.D. at Louisiana State University. I have had a unqiue and non-linear jouney to get where I am today. Upon graduation I plan to pursue a career in data where I can utilize my unique perspectives and techincal skills.

### This webpage is intended to:

- Showcase my technical skills and qualifications for future employers through portfolio projects
- Display my academic publications
- Provide insight through blog posts based on knowledge I've gained throughout my career

### My career path

In addition to my graduate studies, I work as a graduate researcher at the Transboundary and Coastal Ecology Lab at LSU. My dissertation research is centered around flowing freshwater dissolved CO2 across the United States. Ecological data has always been a passion of mine. During my undergrad at the University of Minnesota, I earned a B.S. in Fish and Wildlife Biology.

Prior to entering the world of natural resources, I was an accounting undergrad at the University of Minnesota Duluth. My accounting education ended during my first internship after my third year of university when I realized that accounting was not the right career for me. After reflecting on what's important to me I started to pursue fish and wildlife biology. This brought me to a local Community college and then to the University of Minnesota. However, during this time I didn't stop working in accounting and worked full-time almost entirely through the rest of my undergrad. I even ended up with an Associate's degree in accounting during my year pit stop at community college.

During and after undergrad I worked for a watershed district (municipal government organization) where I was first an intern and then a water resource technician. At the watershed district, I spent my time doing all sorts of fieldwork collecting environmental data. It was there that I started to realize what I love doing, which happened when analyzing the data, we spent all year collecting.

From there I got my current position at LSU. At first, I was hired to pursue a Masterâ€™s, but I quickly transitioned to a Ph.D. after having some early success. While working on my dissertation research and coursework I fully realized what I love doing, which is working with data. From accounting to biology to ecology the common thread has been data. Specifically, what I can do with data from gathering, to analyzing, then finally telling a story.

Once realizing that data science is the career path for me, I decided to fill the rest of my course load with statistics classes and gain any other technical skills I need for the job.

### Personal Life

I love everything about the outdoors and spend as much time as I can in it.

Also, here is a picture of my dog Sprout wearing a fish shirt!
