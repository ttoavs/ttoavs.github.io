## Abstract

Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations in the atmosphere have been steadily increasing since the mid-twentieth century. This rise in CO<sub>2</sub> has been shown to affect a wide range of ecosystems and organisms, with a number of negative effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> documented for marine organisms. Less is known about the dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub> in freshwaters (referred to as the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>, <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>), but the potential exists for freshwater organisms to be challenged by elevated <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>. Direct measures of <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in freshwater are limited making it challenging to define spatial or temporal trends. However, <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> can be estimated from pH, temperature, and alkalinityâ€”commonly collected water quality metrics. We used the National Water Quality Monitoring Council data portal as a source of water quality metrics and the program PHREEQC to estimate <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in flowing freshwaters across 35,000 sites spanning the lower 48 US states (CONUS) from 1990 through 2020. Site data for water chemistry measurements were spatially joined with the National Hydrology Dataset to define sites. Using CDFLOW data we modeled spatiotemporal <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> trends in flowing freshwaters from 1990 through 2020 across the CONUS using linear mixed models. CDFLOW presents an opportunity for spatiotemporal analysis of <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in flowing freshwaters. However, CDFLOW also presents an opportunity for researchers to add <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> to their datasets for further investigation when modeling.
