## Abstract

Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations in the atmosphere have been steadily increasing since the mid-twentieth century. This rise in CO<sub>2</sub> has been shown to affect a wide range of ecosystems and organisms, with a number of negative effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> documented for marine organisms. Less is known about the dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub> in freshwaters, but the potential exists for freshwater organisms to be challenged by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> dynamics in flowing freshwaters exhibit more variability than in lakes or the ocean, yet it remains important to understand changes in CO<sub>2</sub> despite any background fluctuations. Direct measures of CO<sub>2</sub> in freshwater are limited making it challenging to define spatial or temporal trends in CO<sub>2</sub> levels. However, CO<sub>2</sub> can be estimated from pH, temperature, and alkalinityâ€”commonly collected water quality metrics. We used the National Water Quality Monitoring Council data portal as a source of water quality metrics and the program PHREEQC to estimate CO<sub>2</sub> in flowing freshwaters across 50,000 sites spanning the lower 48 US states from 1990 to 2020. Site data for water chemistry measurements were spatially joined with the National Hydrology Dataset to define sites. CDFLOW presents an opportunity for spatiotemporal analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> trends across the United States over the past 30 years.
